## **Overview**  
This repository contains a research hypothesis exploring **black hole quantum superposition and entanglement**. It proposes that **all particles inside a black hole remain in superposition** until the black hole fully evaporates. At the **final stage of Hawking Radiation**, a **global wavefunction collapse** restores the lost quantum information, resolving the **black hole information paradox** while preserving unitarity.  

Additionally, this work examines the feasibility of **artificial event horizons**â€”engineered structures that could **mimic black hole physics** to stabilize entanglement for applications such as:  
- **Quantum information storage**  
- **Teleportation**  
- **Space-time manipulation**
