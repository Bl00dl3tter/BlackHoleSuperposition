# BlackHoleSuperposition
This hypothesis explores black hole superposition and entanglement, proposing that information remains in superposition until evaporation. A final wavefunction collapse restores lost data, resolving the information paradox. It also examines artificial event horizons for stabilizing entanglement and space-time engineering.
